Write a  script that removes a specified word from a given text. Return the new string.
("Exercises Practice Solution", " Solution") -> "Exercises Practice"
("Red Green Blue", "Green") -> "Red Blue"
(" Number Exercises”, “”) -> "Number Exercises"

Write a  script to create a new string repeating every character twice of a given string.
   Sample Output:
   The given string is: welcome
   The new string is: wweellccoommee
   
Given a string of even length, return the first half. So the string "WooHoo" yields "Woo".
firstHalf("WooHoo") → "Woo"
firstHalf("HelloThere") → "Hello"
firstHalf("abcdef") → "abc"   

=====================================================================================================================================================
Encapsulation Question 1. ATMSystem
Problem: Design an ATM class with private fields pin, balance, and attempts. Implement methods to withdraw, deposit, and change PIN. Lock the account after 3 incorrect PIN attempts.
Input:
ATM atm = new ATM(1234, 5000); 
atm.withdraw(1234, 1000); 
atm.changePIN(1234, 5678); 
atm.withdraw(1111, 2000); 
atm.withdraw(1111, 2000); 
atm.withdraw(1111, 2000); 
atm.withdraw(1234, 500); 
Output:
Withdrawn: 1000 
PIN Changed 
Incorrect PIN 
Account Locked

====================================================================================================================================================
Inheritance Question 2: EmployeeManagement
Problem: Design a Person superclass with subclasses Employee and Manager. The Manager class should have an additional field teamSize. Calculate bonus based on role and team size.
Input:
Manager m = new Manager("Alice", 45000, 5); 
Employee e = new Employee("Bob", 30000); 
System.out.println(m.calculateBonus()); 
System.out.println(e.calculateBonus()); 
Output:
Manager Bonus: 7500 
Employee Bonus: 3000 

========================================================================================================================================================
Polymorphism Question 3. VehiclePolymorphism
Problem: Create a superclass Vehicle with a method start(). Implement a subclass Car that overrides the start() method.
Input:
Vehicle vehicle = new Car().
vehicle.start();
Output:
Car is starting.

=====================================================================================================================================================
Abstraction - Question 4: Animal Abstraction
Problem: Create an abstract class Animal with an abstract method makeSound(). Implement subclasses Dog and Cat that override the makeSound() method.
Input:
Animal animal1 = new Dog();
Animal animal2 = new Cat();
animal1.makeSound();
animal2.makeSound();
Output:
Barking.
Meowing.

=====================================================================================================================================================
Constructor - 5. Constructor Overloading
Problem: Create a class Book with two constructors: one accepts title and author, and the other accepts title, author, and price. Print the details of the book.
Input:
Book book1 = new Book("Java Basics", "John Doe");
Book book2 = new Book("Advanced Java", "Jane Doe", 49.99);
Output:
Title: Java Basics, Author: John Doe, Price: Not Available
Title: Advanced Java, Author: Jane Doe, Price: 49.99

=====================================================================================================================================================
Interface - 6. Orderable Interface
Problem: Create an interface Orderable with a method placeOrder(). Implement it in the classes Pizza and Burger.
Input:
Orderable food1 = new Pizza();
Orderable food2 = new Burger();
food1.placeOrder();
food2.placeOrder();
Output:
Pizza order placed.
Burger order placed.
